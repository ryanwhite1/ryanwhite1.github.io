											<h2>My time as a professional landscape artist</h2>
											<p>
												I've been very lucky to have success as a traditional artist. Take a look at some of my favourite paintings! 
											</p>
										</header>
										<p>
											For some time after high school I started painting to fill in the time and develop a new skill. After enough practice, I started getting 
											reasonably good at it and eventually I decided to take a couple of years off during my undergraduate degrees in order to focus on landscape
											painting full time. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ryrythepaintingguy?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw==" style="color: maroon">You can take a look at
											my work here.</a> I originally learnt from the free Bob Ross <i>The Joy of Painting</i> videos on YouTube and built my style from there. Each 
											photorealistic painting is a very long process (usually taking anywhere from 40-80 hours per small painting!) and it was great to get into 
											the zone.  
										</p>

										<p>
											<i>Painting #71 — 30x60cm Oil on Wooden Panel — Cradle Mountain, Tasmania, Aus</i>
										</p>
										<p>
											This was taken on my first trip to Tasmania in May of 2017. Cradle Mountain National Park will forever be one of my happy places on Earth,
											and I've visited it twice since then. Truly it is one of the most beautiful places I've ever seen and everyone should visit at some point 
											in their life. 
										</p>

										<p>
											<i>Painting #67 — 30x30cm Oil on Wooden Panel — Hooker Valley, New Zealand</i>
										</p>
										<p>
											Regrettably, the reference for this painting was not photographed by me and I have not yet been to New Zealand although the South Island
											is the place I most want to visit. I won an 'Emerging Artist Award' at the d'Arcy Doyle Art Awards for this painting, with a monetary prize. 
										</p>

											<i>Painting #76 - 45x45cm Oil on Wooden Panel — Robina, Queensland, Aus</i>
										</p>
										<p>
											I've spent several years living on the Gold Coast — while the GC Hinterland is beautiful and well worthy of painting, the suburbs of the city is maybe not so.
											Despite this, I managed to find a pocket of beauty well within a commercial centre of the city in the suburb of Robina. This reference was taken about a 10 minute 
											walk from where I was living at the time.
										</p>
										<a href="images/paintings/painting64.jpg" class="image featured"><img src="images/paintings/painting64.jpg" alt="" /></a>
										<p>
											<i>Painting #64 - 30x60cm Oil on Wooden Panel — Yosemite Valley, California, USA</i>
										</p>
										<p>
											For a long while this was my favourite painting of mine. I'd day dreamed for a long time about just sitting on the side of this creek.
										</p>
										<a href="images/paintings/painting74.png" class="image featured"><img src="images/paintings/painting74.png" alt="" /></a>
										<p>
											<i>Painting #74 - 30x45cm Oil on Wooden Panel — Currumbin Creek, Queensland, Aus</i>
										</p>
										<p>
											Currumbin Creek is one of my happy places on the Gold Coast. I was very fortunate to go to school right next to it, so I would walk up and down
											this creek every day for years. Walking along the adjacent board walk as the sun rises is one of life's great pleasures. I would kayak along 
											it in the summer, and it was always exciting to see hundreds of jellyfish in the creek within arms reach.
										</p>

										<p>
											<i>Painting #70 - 20x60cm Oil on Wooden Panel — Great Ocean Road, Victoria, Aus</i>
										</p>
										<p>
											Another one from my trip with my sister in 2018. I was listening to a dangerous amount of Tusk while painting this one too. I think 'Storms'
											pairs well with this painting.

											<p>
												<i>Painting #80 — 24x36cm Oil on Wooden Panel — 12 Apostles, Victoria, Aus</i>
											</p>
											<p>
												This is one of my favourite paintings, in part because the reference image was taken during a lovely holiday I was having with my 
												older sister in 2018. The moment before sunrise here was the coldest temperature I'd ever experienced (a feels like of -2C) at the time. 
												Overall I just have very good memories visiting this beautiful area, and I was listening to deep cuts of Fleetwood Mac while painting it,
												and Tusk is one of my all-time favourite albums as a result.

											<p>
												<i>Painting #78 — 45x22cm Oil on Wooden Panel — Cape Caneveral, Florida, USA</i>
											</p>
											<p>
												This was one of my first times painting a non-landscape subject, which was a specifically requested commission. The subject is 
												a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket during liftoff; as conflicted as I am now about SpaceX (due to my background as an astronomer), I 
												can't deny the innovation that SpaceX has had in the private spaceflight industry and it is a cool image that was fun to paint.

											<p>
												<i>Painting #72 — 60x45cm Oil on Wooden Panel — Kondalilla NP, Queensland, Aus</i>
											</p>
											<p>
												Another painting of which I did not take the reference myself (regrettably), but it is a beautiful scene not far from where I was living 
												in Queensland at the time of painting. This painting was hanging in the halls of the Clayton Utz office in Brisbane for 1 year as part of the 
												prestigious Clayton Utz Art Awards.

											<p>
												<i>Painting #75 — 30x30cm Oil on Wooden Panel — Tallebudgera Creek, Queensland, Aus</i>
											</p>
											<p>
												Initially I was unsure about painting this one — I tend to shy away from more beach-y scenes and Tallebudgera Creek is one of the 
												Gold Coast's iconic beaches. This was a requested painting by Terri, the director of 19Karen gallery, and she insisted that I paint the 
												people that were in the dead centre in the reference image; I was apprehensive, but I think it came out nicely.

											<p>
												<i>Painting #68 — 24x36cm Oil on Wooden Panel — Mossman Gorge, Queensland, Aus</i>
											</p>
											<p>
												Put simply, I was really drawn to the underwater rocks in the reference image for this painting. Actually really fun to paint.
